This is my game that I have been working for multiple months now, it is still a work in progress and thus has bugs, but for the most part the game is playable and has a wide variety of features to make it enjoyable. Assests and item stats were generated by Leonardo.ai/github co-pilot to improve efficency and consistentcy.
